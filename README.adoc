== Pipeline Steps

The following Jenkins pipeline steps are available.

=== **hubotSend**

Sends a given message to site/room.

[source,groovy]
----
hubotSend message: 'Releasing Test project.'
----

* *message* `required`, actual message to send.
* *status* `optional`, text which can be used in script to differentiate. Ex: INFO, WARN, ERROR or SUCCESS - So that in Slack it can be used to decide card colors.
* *tokens* `optional`, list of tokens, comma separated, Refer to https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin[Token Macro plugin] for more information.
* *extraData* `optional`, extra data like attachments in case of slack, Any kind of Map, given it is Serializable.
* *site* `optional`, hubot site name either it is from Folder Level or Global Level, Only used when *url* is not present. Optional, it will fallback to first default site that it found while searching from immediate folder to Global site configurations.
* *url* `optional`, if it is provided as global environment variable *HUBOT_URL* or provided by `withEnv` step, this should always end with `/`, environment variable takes the lower precedence.
* *room* `optional`, if it is provided as global environment variable *HUBOT_DEFAULT_ROOM* or provided by `withEnv` step, and room doesn't require `#`, it is added in the code, environment variable takes the lower precedence.
* *failOnError* `optional` and by default it is `true`, if any error it won't abort the job, it can also be provided as global environment variable *HUBOT_FAIL_ON_ERROR*, environment variable takes the lower precedence.

=== **hubotApprove**

Sends a hubot message the project chat room for a project when the build is waiting for user input with the hubot commands to proceed or abort the build.

[source,groovy]
----
hubotApprove message: 'Promote to Production?'
----

* *message* `required`, actual message to send.
* *status* `optional`, text which can be used in script to differentiate. Ex: INFO, WARN, ERROR or SUCCESS - So that in Slack it can be used to decide card colors.
* *tokens* `optional`, list of tokens, comma separated, Refer to https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin[Token Macro plugin] for more information.
* *extraData* `optional`, extra data like attachments in case of slack, Any kind of Map, given it is Serializable.
* *site* `optional`, hubot site name either it is from Folder Level or Global Level, Only used when *url* is not present. Optional, it will fallback to first default site that it found while searching from immediate folder to Global site configurations.
* *url* `optional`, if it is provided as global environment variable *HUBOT_URL* or provided by `withEnv` step, this should always end with `/`, environment variable takes the lower precedence.
* *room* `optional`, if it is provided as global environment variable *HUBOT_DEFAULT_ROOM* or provided by `withEnv` step, and room doesn't require `#`, it is added in the code, environment variable takes the lower precedence.
* *failOnError* `optional` and by default it is `true`, if any error it won't abort the job, it can also be provided as global environment variable *HUBOT_FAIL_ON_ERROR*, environment variable takes the lower precedence.
* *id* `optional`, defaults to *Proceed*, refer to https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/pipeline-input-step/[input step] for more information.
* *submitter* `optional`, comma separated list of users who can provide input. Refer to https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/pipeline-input-step/[input step] for more information.

== Hubot Setup

=== New to hubot?

Refer to https://github.com/ThoughtsLive/hubot-base[hubot-base] to setup a either docker container or to run it locally.

TIP: Please replace scripts on hubot-base repo with the scripts under this hubot-steps repo and it is always a good idea to copy over the scripts from appropriate tag based on the version being installed on Jenkins.

=== Already running hubot.

Then just copy over following scripts from `scripts` folder (jenkins, and one of the hubot scripts based on chat service you are using.). These are just examples and can be modified based on chat service / per the actual needs.

* https://github.com/jenkinsci/hubot-steps/blob/master/scripts/hubot_slack.coffee[hubot_slack]
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/hubot-steps/blob/master/scripts/hubot.coffee[hubot]
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/hubot-steps/blob/master/scripts/jenkins.coffee[jenkins]

----
==== With Site Name either at Folder or Global level.

[source,groovy]
