This step sends a message to hubot and pauses Pipeline execution and allows the user to interact and control the flow of the build. Only a basic "process" or "abort" option is provided in the stage view.

You can optionally request information back, hence the name of the step. The parameter entry screen can be accessed via a link at the bottom of the build console log or via link in the sidebar for a build.
